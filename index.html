Under his captaincy, India has reached several milestones including becoming the number-one team in Test cricket and reaching the final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. He has also been honoured with several awards for his performances including the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for ICC ODI Player of the Year in 2017 and 2018.
